- Initializes logo container and SVG
- Sets up block tracking system
- Creates completion message element

extractBlocks()
- Processes SVG rectangles into tracked blocks
- Creates unique IDs based on coordinates
- Returns array of block objects with:
  * id: coordinate-based identifier
  * color: original color value
  * element: DOM reference

styleLogoContainer()
- Sets up responsive sizing
- Applies initial grayscale filter
- Configures transitions and animations

startPulsatingAnimation()
- Manages opacity pulsing for current food block
- Runs on 1-second interval
- Only active before full revelation

getNextFoodColor()
- Selects random unrevealed block for food
- Returns color for food generation
- Handles post-completion color selection

revealColor(color)
- Reveals specific block matching food color
- Updates tracking systems
- Manages block removal from remaining pool
- Sets up next food block

checkLogoCompletion()
- Monitors revealed block count
- Triggers completion at 49 blocks
- Shows completion message
- Ensures full opacity on all blocks

reset()
- Restores initial grayscale state
- Clears tracking systems
- Resets completion status
```

### Block Tracking System

```javascript
Block Object Structure:
{
    id: "x,y",          // Unique position identifier
    color: "#XXXXXX",   // Original color value
    element: DOMElement // Reference to SVG rect
}

Tracking Collections:
- this.blocks: All 49 blocks
- this.remainingBlocks: Unrevealed blocks
- this.revealedBlocks: Set of revealed block IDs
```

### State Management

```javascript
Game States:
- Initial: All blocks grayscale
- In Progress: Mixed grayscale and color
- Complete: All blocks colored

Block States:
- Unrevealed: Grayscale
- Current Food: Pulsing opacity
- Revealed: Full color, full opacity
```

## CSS Styling
